![Face Swapper](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Releases-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=flat&logo=github&logoColor=white)

## Overview

Face Swapper is a Python project designed to automate the creation of 100 curated face-swaps. This project strategically selects faces across four categories: similar, dissimilar, random, and processed. The goal is to build a diverse dataset that can train powerful face-swap detection models. 

Utilizing the insightface library's Inswapper model, Face Swapper provides a straightforward way to generate and manage your face-swap datasets efficiently.

## Features

- **Automated Face-Swapping**: Easily create face-swaps without manual effort.
- **Curated Selection**: Generate face-swaps from four distinct categories.
- **Diverse Dataset**: Build a dataset that enhances model training for face-swap detection.
- **Insightface Integration**: Leverage the advanced capabilities of the Inswapper model.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple setup and execution process.

## Getting Started

To get started with Face Swapper, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MaxMassi/Face-Swapper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Face-Swapper
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download and Execute

You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/MaxMassi/Face-Swapper/releases). Look for the appropriate file, download it, and execute it according to the instructions provided in the release notes.

## Usage

To create face-swaps, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python face_swapper.py --category <category_name>
```

Replace `<category_name>` with one of the following:

- `similar`
- `dissimilar`
- `random`
- `processed`

### Example

For example, to create face-swaps from the "similar" category, use:

```bash
python face_swapper.py --category similar
```

This command will generate face-swaps based on the selected category and save them to the output directory.
